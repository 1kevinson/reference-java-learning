# Java Programming Learning Repository

Welcome to my personal programming learning repository! This is where I document my journey through java programming language and spring frameworks, and technologies. Each folder contains notes, code examples, projects, and resources related to different aspects of programming.

## 📚 Repository Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A centralized location for all my programming learning materials
- A reference guide for concepts I've studied
- A portfolio of training, practice projects and code examples
- A tracking system for my progress in java and spring

## 📁 Folder Organization

## 🗂️ File Naming Conventions

- **Notes**: Use descriptive names like `variables-and-data-types.md`
- **Code Examples**: Include purpose in filename like `sorting-algorithms-example.py`
- **Projects**: Use kebab-case like `task-management-app/`
- **Documentation**: Keep it simple like `README.md`, `NOTES.md`, `TODO.md`

## 📝 Documentation Standards

Each major folder should contain:
- **README.md**: Overview of the topic and folder contents
- **NOTES.md**: Detailed study notes and key concepts
- **RESOURCES.md**: Links to helpful learning materials
